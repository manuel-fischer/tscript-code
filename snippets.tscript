# CHARACTERS OF A STRING
# Iterate through characters of a string without converting them to an integer
# Explanation: String.split("") splits each character of the string, resulting
#              in an array, where each element is a string with only one
#              character.
# following example prints each character of "Hello World!" in a single line
for var c in "Hello World!".split("") do
	print(c)
